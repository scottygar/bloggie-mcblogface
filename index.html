      <p>2020 KTB is complete. It’s been a long month.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiday passed far too quick.</li>
<li>All Tibco 2020 work promoted to MDev &amp; working.</li>
<li>SM VB dev completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been a busy month, full of teamwork from many different areas. 2020 has been completed, with a few hitches along the way - but we’re in and working. It’s been an experience with many ups and downs - from starting off with little knowledge of anything that’s going on and finding it hard to get any information, to seeing that it’s a project with several really promising ideas - and knowing how all the parts fit together.</p>
<p>It’s quite compelling seeing so many different areas in a standup together and talking/working as a team.</p>
<p>Speaking of working as a team, I feel like the Tibco team are working better together - It feels less broken. SL is starting to come out of her shell, and switching projects has given us a chance to appreciate what the others do. DM did some cool stuff with 2020 while I was away and it was nice to be able to come back and understand/add into what was done.</p>
<p>As a side note/project, I’ve completed a relatively small, but important piece of VBA for the SM team. It’ll reduce workload and a real pain point for managers completing the forms that are required. Hopefully.</p>
<p>Risk have also asked me to pop in and talk to them about agile. Something I need to prepare for, as I’m by no means an expert. It’ll be a good stretch for me to try to get them to take some of the stuff we do on-board. Standups as a first measure.</p>
<p>Learnings: Teamwork &amp; non-silos across the business <strong>are</strong> possible. It might just take a while.</p>

      <p>So a month has passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 has commenced in service layer. With a bang.<ul>
<li>I am the sole Tibco dev.</li>
<li>Full development of all services required.</li>
<li>Integration of services with new tools.</li>
<li>Tunnels within tunnels within tunnels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 4 weeks has been a crazy blur. 2020 has taken over my life, caused me more political nightmares than I ever knew were possible and proved to me that I have a lot of skill with the tools I’m working with.</p>
<p>My service layer is almost complete, built from scratch with very little help - this is my first large scale display of what I have achieved over the last year. And I have the small plus of people referring to me as the lead Tibco dev on the project. That felt good.</p>
<p>The new tools are both great and horrific in the same breath. They do some awesome things but can be horrible to talk to and get information from. I did enjoy being able to go back and make requests of other people though, made me feel like I’m gaining credibility with the other devs.</p>
<p>Tunnelling is my new favourite past-time. Or at least you’d thing it is. It’s been a huge challenge to get my head around where I need to tunnel to and how tunnels even work. </p>
<p>My record so far is 9 tunnels at once. It’s not something I’m proud of.</p>
<p>Learnings: <strong>Don’t be afraid to put yourself forward and ask the difficult questions.</strong> DP has proved that it can actually be very beneficial and people have listened to the request and given us a lot of information.</p>

      <p>It’s been a long, slow couple of weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit Limit is essentially finished.</li>
<li>First solo standup.</li>
<li>Values award nomination.</li>
<li>C2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit Limit has been less of a challenge than I thought it would be (so far). I think I’ve learned more than I give myself credit for over the last 10 months.</p>
<p>It’s not really an achievement, but I held my first mobile standup this week. It’s interesting to see that JJ is happy to give me that role before others who have been in the team longer.</p>
<p>DT arrived at my desk today and said that he’s putting me forward for a values award, which is awesome. Turns out that putting that much effort into getting to the hackathon was not only worth it, but seen from a distance as well.</p>
<p>C2020 looks interesting. Last week was dipping my toes in the water and this week should see us start to get involved in the detail. It could be a huge project with a lot of work, or it could be a huge problem with a lot of work. Dependent on where the business decides to take it and the key architecture that’s implemented.</p>
<p>It’s going to be an interesting journey either way.</p>
<p>Also.. Pokemon go is ruining my life. But I love it.</p>

      <p>Douglas has returned!<br>Not that there was much issue whilst he was off:</p>
<ul>
<li>GI successful deployment.</li>
<li>Loans had one issue, which I found in the logs and pointed them in the right direction (not me!)</li>
<li>PCA we don’t talk about, as they don’t know what they want. Twice.</li>
<li>SSCA is an absolute monster, but I’m getting there. Slowly.</li>
<li>Hackathon.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very successful couple of weeks. I have started creating the all important network that, until now, I had been shielded from. People have been coming to me with questions and I’ve been finding that I can answer them. Which I didn’t necessarily expect.</p>
<p>And then the two weeks were capped off with the Hackathon. A great trip for Me, John, Mitesh, Megan and Jacob. First Hackathon, first podium finish. The idea of a garbage saver went down a treat, hooked into that all important loyalty system. Great feedback from the CTO, and I’m now intrigued to see if they take it on and make it happen.<br>Might pop the champagne cork winnings later..</p>
<p>Learnings: I need to have more confidence in myself. The two times I asked for help, I got a terrible answer that I didn’t question. <strong>Must. Question. More.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeh.. and Pokemon go. It will ruin my life.</p>

      <p>This week has been a fruitful, if extremely long week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Factory 1 config is nearing completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that’s all I’ve done. All week. From start to finish. Monday to Friday. ALL WEEK!</p>
<p>Learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying a factory instance is not as easy as it sounds. (Don’t try it again - and if you do, be aware that there’s a lot of stuff you need to re-configure).</li>
<li>Jenkins allows for configurable builds, and you can carry variables through those builds for deployment purposes.</li>
<li>The original SOAP tests that I wrote on my first service were awful, and I need to re-do them.</li>
<li>SOAP has an option to add the same endpoint to all services, meaning I will waste no further time typing it in manually.</li>
<li>If you’re in the admin console, your build will not deploy.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it’s been a good week for learning. I now know what the build scripts actually do (and where they are failing silently), so I can go and amend them over the next couple of weeks. I really need to get to grips with Datagrid and deployments to SIT before Douglas goes away though.</p>

      <p>The learning curve continues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean setup and config of new Continuous Integration Server (Factory1).</li>
<li>Loans service completed.</li>
<li>Update Money Transfer code.</li>
<li>Demo of JSON parsing for the rest of the team.</li>
<li>Learning deployment processes for when Douglas is away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factory 1 setup has been an absolute beast. (Though I did spend a long time looking at port config, which has been resolved by the VPN I knew nothing about..). The re-config of Tibco machines and Jenkins integration is still being a pest, but I’m getting there.</p>
<p>Loans was a different challenge, but one that went really well. I feel like I’m getting a broader knowledge of the business as a whole.</p>
<p>JSON parse demo went really well -<br>The others gave me some food for thought and some tweaks I could make.</p>
<p>Deployment processes seem…. interesting. There’s a lot of paperwork, and I need the full end to end process documented before Douglas leaves.</p>
<p>In other news, CB didn’t like my App idea that I submitted, so some thinking to do before next year.</p>

      <p>This week has been a learning curve of sorts.</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON handling PoC completed and stored for future use.</li>
<li>RESTful service PoC completed for PCU and stored for future use.</li>
<li>IA completed for a new loans service.</li>
<li>IA completed for PCAO.</li>
</ul>
<p>IAs are not the easiest thing in the world - Basically trying to step through all the changes you need to make without actually completing them, and trying to foresee any issues this may cause.</p>
<p>The JSON handling is in a state where it works, as long as the order is specified - which isn’t really what JSON is about, so some refactoring to do there. (Or the potential purchase of a plugin to make it easier).</p>
<p>RESTful service is completed and ready to use / be adapted for future use in other projects - I think this will happen if we promote the fact that we can do it.</p>
<p>Now for holiday - Bring on Portugal.</p>
